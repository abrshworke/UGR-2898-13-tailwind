        <h2 class="eduk">Education at Addis Ababa University</h2>
        <p>
          In my educational journey at Addis Ababa University, I've had the privilege of exploring the intricate balance between science, art, and philosophy within the realm of software engineering. The courses in my program have not only delved into the technical aspects of coding and system design but also emphasized the importance of creativity and user-centric design. This fusion of science and art is particularly evident in web development, where coding is akin to crafting a digital masterpiece. I've come to appreciate that the artistry lies not only in writing efficient code but also in creating an engaging user experience that seamlessly blends aesthetics with functionality.

            Moreover, philosophy plays a crucial role in shaping my approach as a junior web developer. The ethical considerations and critical thinking fostered by philosophical studies are essential in navigating the complexities of the digital landscape. Questions about user privacy, accessibility, and the societal impact of technology require a thoughtful and principled approach. Thus, my education has not only equipped me with technical skills but also instilled a holistic perspective that recognizes the interconnectedness of science, art, and philosophy in the ever-evolving field of software engineering.
